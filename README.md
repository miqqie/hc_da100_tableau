📊 **Tableau Dashboard:** [View here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rin.aw/viz/shared/K2HSPSSCC)  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project analyses **41,707 GoCard transactions ($7.2M total) across Singapore malls (Oct 2018 – May 2020)** to uncover spending patterns and identify strategies to boost credit card usage.  

The raw data was extracted using SQL, and data visualisation and analysis were conducted in Tableau to bring insights to life.

The analysis helps **GoCard’s product & marketing teams** make data-driven decisions to grow transaction volume and market share.

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- **Big-ticket spenders rule:** Installments & travel make up the bulk of spending (~$4.9M) and drive volatility in quarterly trends.  
- **Everyday essentials are steady:** Food & grocery are consistent but smaller contributors—prime for loyalty programmes.  
- **Geography matters:** North & East towns (e.g. Admiralty, Tampines) dominate transactions; Orchard underperforms despite its high mall density.  
- **Online payments dominate:** 75% of transactions by value, with much higher spend per transaction vs. physical or virtual cards.

## 🎯 Recommendations  
- Partner with **retailers & travel agencies** for promotions and events targeting high-value categories.  
- Build **long-term reward schemes** to encourage steady food & grocery spending.  
- Launch **location-based campaigns** in underperforming towns to boost awareness and usage.  
- Double down on **online payment adoption** by improving UX and offering incentives.

## 🔍 Next Steps  
To deepen insights:  
- Add **customer demographics** (age, gender, household data) for targeted campaigns.  
- Include **online shopping transactions** for a fuller picture.  
- Link **marketing campaign timelines** to spending trends to measure impact.
